This repository contains the slides for the talk "Deep Learning feedbacks: Reproducibility, Hyperparameters" given by Jean-Luc Charles, during the IA day at IRCER Limoges on 2025/03/14.

if you want to access the notebooks used as examples in these slides, you can have a look on the repositories:
- https://github.com/cjlux/Reproductibility-MNIST-DNN-CPU<br>
the non-reproducibility of neural networks training and how to fix it, based on simple Dense Neural Network (DNN).
- https://github.com/cjlux/Reproductibility-MNIST-CNN-GPU<br>
the non-reproducibility of neural networks training and the influence of hyperparamters (example: _batch_size_), based on a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
